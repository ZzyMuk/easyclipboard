## ðŸŽ¯ Customize Hotkeys

The script uses default hotkeys:
- `Ctrl + Shift + C` â€” copy subtitle text
- `Ctrl + Shift + X` â€” extract audio

Want to use mouse side buttons instead?
Replace these hotkeys in the script:

```autohotkey
^+c:: ; Ctrl + Shift + C
```
with
```autohotkey
XButton2::
```
and

```autohotkey
^+x:: ; Ctrl + Shift + X
```
with
```autohotkey
XButton1::
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This script uses MPC-HC's web interface to extract the current timestamp and video path.
- Audio is extracted with `ffmpeg` using the Japanese audio stream if available.
- Audio recording only works for Japanese if your video file has several audio streams change to desired language in: language:jpn
